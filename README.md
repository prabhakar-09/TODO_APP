# TODO_APP
• The TODO web app is a simple task management application built using Angular and TypeScript, enabling users to create, view, update, and delete tasks easily. • To store the data, the application uses JSON Server, a lightweight tool that allows for the creation of a fake RESTful API with a JSON file.
